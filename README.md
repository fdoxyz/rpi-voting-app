Example Voting App (For Raspbery PI)
====================================

This is an example Docker app with multiple services, adapted for ARM processors using the Hypriot OS. It is run with Docker Compose and uses Docker Networking to connect containers together.

It is based on https://github.com/docker/example-voting-app

Architecture
-----

* A Python webapp which lets you vote between two options
* A Redis queue which collects new votes
* A Java worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
* A Postgres database backed by a Docker volume
* A Node.js webapp which shows the results of the voting in real time

Running
-------

Since this app makes use of Compose's experimental networking support, it must be started with:

    $ cd vote-apps/worker
    $ make build # Will pre-build the java application for the worker and copy it locally
    $ cd ..
    $ docker-compose --x-networking up -d

The app will be running on port 5000 on your Docker host, and the results will be on port 5001.
